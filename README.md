## Stargate

Stargate is a free, open source, medieval sandbox adventure game, created using the [Minetest engine](https://github.com/minetest/minetest).  
Feel free to contribute and early pull request :)

### Project Goals

- A fun, open world experience
- Polished gameplay and visuals
- Open to community feedback
- Code repackaged as individual mods

Issues and suggestions regarding these goals are more than welcome!


### Version Scheme

We will use `major.minor.patch`

 - major is used when the release contains changes that break Stargate mods or texture packs (such as new nodes or changes to core functionality).  Other numbers are set to 0.
 - minor is used when the release includes no breaking changes.  Patch is set to 0.
 - patch is for non-breaking bugfixes or similar changes.
 
 A "-beta.x" after the version number symbolizes a non-final release.  Mods or texture packs based on developement versions *will not be supported*.
 
**A roadmap will be added later in developement**
