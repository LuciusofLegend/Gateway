## Gateway

Gateway is an alternative base to Minetest modding, with the goal of setting a higher standard for Minetest content.  If you don't know what Minetest is, here's a link to [the website](https://minetest.net).

### Info
Gateway will be realeased in three main forms:  As a modpack, as individual mods, and as a game.<br/>
There will be a few gists too (things like minetest.conf for the physics).

We are looking for contributors and testers!  If you have an interest in pixel art, sound design, procedural generation or coding, we'll have something for you to help with.  And if you're a modder, you can let us know how good of a base it makes for your own mods.

We plan to have mod jams in the future, in order to let you show off your modding skills and test the quality of this project.

Proper feedback is very important for open source projects.  If you find a bug or something that bothers you, the best thing you can do is make an issue [here](https://github.com/LuciusofLegend/MT-Gateway/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).  Thank you :D

### Project Goals

- Nice textures
- Improved physics
- Engaging combat
- Easy-to-navigate file structure
- Other cool features

### Version Scheme

We will use `major.minor.patch`

 - major is used when the release contains changes that break mods or texture packs.  Other numbers are set to 0.
 - minor is used when the release includes no breaking changes.  Patch is set to 0.
 - patch is for non-breaking bugfixes or similar changes.
 
 A "-beta.x" after the version number symbolizes a non-final or testing release.  We don't recommend using such verisons for your mod.
