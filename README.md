## Gateway

Gateway is an alternative base to Minetest modding, with the goal of setting a higher standard for Minetest content.  If you don't know what Minetest is, here's a link [to the website](https://minetest.net).

### Project Goals

- Nice textures
- Improved physics
- Engaging combat
- Easy-to-understand file structure
- Other cool features

### Notes
We will be listening intently to any and all of your feedback!  If you have a suggestion to help us meet these goals, please make an issue :)

We plan to have mod jams in the future, in order to let you show off your modding skills and test the quality of this project.

A roadmap will be added in the future as well.

### Version Scheme

We will use `major.minor.patch`

 - major is used when the release contains changes that break Terrasmith mods or texture packs (such as new nodes or changes to core functionality).  Other numbers are set to 0.
 - minor is used when the release includes no breaking changes.  Patch is set to 0.
 - patch is for non-breaking bugfixes or similar changes.
 
 A "-beta.x" after the version number symbolizes a non-final or testing release.  We don't recommend using such verisons for your mod.
