Feel free to contribute and early pull request :)

### Project Goals

- Simple building and engaging adventures
- Cohesive experience
- Nice visuals
- Responsiveness to feedback
- Compatibility

If you see anything we can change to better meet these goals, *please* make an issue!


### Version Scheme

We will use `major.minor.patch`

 - major is used when the release contains changes that break Terrasmith mods or texture packs (such as new nodes or changes to core functionality).  Other numbers are set to 0.
 - minor is used when the release includes no breaking changes.  Patch is set to 0.
 - patch is for non-breaking bugfixes or similar changes.
 
 A "-beta.x" after the version number symbolizes a non-final or testing release.  Mods or texture packs based on developement versions *will not be supported*.
 
**A roadmap will be added later in developement**
